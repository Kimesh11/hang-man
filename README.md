# Hangman Game (React)

A simple, interactive Hangman game built using **React**.  
This project serves as a capstone to consolidate concepts such as:
- JSX
- React components
- State management
- Event handling
- Component interaction
- Responsive UI using React-Bootstrap

The user must guess a hidden word by selecting letters. Each wrong guess draws another step of the hangman 
until the player either wins by guessing correctly or loses when the hangman is complete.

---

## How to Play

- The game selects a **random word**.
- Click letters to guess the hidden word.
- Correct guesses reveal letters.
- Incorrect guesses increase the hangman drawing.
- You can lose after too many wrong guesses.
- You can restart the game after you've won or lost.
- You can request help from the UI.
